# Project_2_431
Team 3's project 2 submission for CS 431. Our project is to study the Red language.

## Topics
We will be covering:
- Installation of the language, preferably in WSL
(direct install, but using Docker might be an option,
if there are usable official Docker images)
- requirements for the installation
- main motivations and characteristics (such as
paradigms and typing disciplines) of the language
- main usage of the language, preferably using
VS Code, with examples of implementing data structures, concurrency,
map/reduce/filter, tail recursion, etc.
- shortcomings of the (current version of the) language
- their plans for the future of the language
